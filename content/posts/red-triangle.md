#date: "2019-03-10"
summary: The red inverted triangle emoji's use in signifying pro-Palestinian sentiment comes from a mix of historical symbolism related to Palestinian identity and resistance, and more recent, specific adoption by Hamas for targeting in conflict. Its deployment today carries multifaceted meanings, reflecting both solidarity with Palestinian struggles and, in some contexts, explicit support for militant actions against Israel.
