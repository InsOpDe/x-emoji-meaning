Summary: |
  The kiwi emoji has been adopted by the TERF movement as a symbol, reflecting their belief in only two genders based on biological sex, thereby excluding transgender identities.

    <br/>
  The choice of the kiwi symbolizes the binary sex distinction in its plant biology, with male and female plants having visibly different reproductive parts.

  Its usage surged after a controversial science event where a lecture supporting binary gender views was canceled but later made available online.
