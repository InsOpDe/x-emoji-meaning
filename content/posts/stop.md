Summary: |
  Effective altruism (EA) is a philosophical and social movement that is focused on finding the most effective ways to do good for the maximum number of people. In the context of AI, EA advocates for the development and application of AI technologies that maximize positive societal impact while minimizing potential harms and heavily rely on the principles of AI ethics.
