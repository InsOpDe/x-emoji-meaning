# X Emoji Meanings
Emojis are more than just little characters that visually spice up a chat or online text. Many of the small images have a hidden meaning. On Twitter and other social platforms, you may come across users who have a certain emoji in their name. What's behind it?

Remember, the meaning of emojis can be very fluid, context-dependent, and sometimes personal. Users might put emojis in their handles for reasons beyond these general interpretations, like personal significance, aesthetic choice, or to follow trends.
